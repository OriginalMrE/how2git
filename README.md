# how2git
This is a repo I'm using for the purposes of learning how to use git.
There isn't really anything of interest here, and if you've stumbled onto this 
repo, I appologize for the lack of interesting things going on here.
If you decide to contribute for some reason, there's a strong chance your code 
will be deleted/modified for no good reason since I'm still learning the 
basics.
